# Eda-FlightPrice-Project

Project Overview:
The purpose of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Flight Price Analysis Dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset that can provide insights into the factors influencing flight prices. By analyzing flight data, we aim to understand what variables affect ticket pricing, such as the day of the week, seasonality, flight duration, airlines, and other external factors. This EDA will help inform potential strategies for travelers to book flights at better prices and help airlines optimize their pricing strategies.

Objective:
The main objectives of this project are to:

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and converting data into a usable format.
Data Exploration: Analyze the key features to understand their distribution, relationships, and impact on flight prices.
Visualization: Use various visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to depict the data and communicate insights effectively.
Insight Generation: Extract actionable insights regarding flight price trends, booking patterns, and factors influencing ticket prices.

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating static visualizations.
Plotly (optional) for interactive visualizations.


Exploratory Data Analysis Report: A comprehensive report detailing the findings from the exploratory analysis, including summary statistics, visualizations, and key insights.
Visualization Dashboard: An interactive or static dashboard presenting key insights, including price distributions, correlations between variables, and time-based trends.
Predictive Model (Optional): A basic model predicting flight prices based on important features, along with an evaluation of its performance (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
Potential Insights:
Factors influencing price: Understanding which factors most significantly impact flight prices (e.g., flight duration, number of stops, airline).
Price trends over time: Identifying if prices are more expensive during peak seasons, or if last-minute bookings tend to be more costly.
Airline price comparison: Identifying which airlines are consistently more expensive and whether these prices are justified based on flight duration or service quality.
Booking strategies: Helping travelers understand the best time to book flights for the cheapest tickets, based on historical trends and lead times.
